Data from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/polls

FiveThirtyEight publish a lot of their data to their https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data repository - but their latest polling data is not in GitHub as far as I can tell. They license it under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license - I'm mirroring it here for convenience and to track changes to it.
